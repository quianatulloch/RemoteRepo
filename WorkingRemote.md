# What is a Remote Repository?
A remote repository is the same Git repository like yours but it exists somewhere else.
  * git remote - manage remote repository
  * git push - send changes to remote repo
  * git pull - retrieve updates from the remote repo

Remotes can be accessed in a couple of ways, with a URL or a path to a file system
## Git remote command
The command will let you manage and interact with remote repositories. The output of '$ git remote' is just the word origin. Well that's weird. The word "origin", here, is referred to as a "shortname". A shortname is just a short and easy way to refer to the location of the remote repository
